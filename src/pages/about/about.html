<p> Ionic was founded in 2012, when using web technologies as a means to build native apps was still in its infancy. When we started, 
we just wanted to create a better way for web developers to use their existing skillsets to build apps for the app stores.
</p>
<p>Today, Ionic is the world's most popular cross-platform mobile development technology stack, powering fast growing startups to some of 
the biggest companies in the world. </p>
